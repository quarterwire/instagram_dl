Dependency management
---------------------

- Package dependencies for developers should be listed in ``requirements.txt``.
- Alternatively, consider using http://pipenv.readthedocs.io.
- Package dependencies for users of your code (who will probably install via pip) should be listed in ``setup.py``.


Code style
----------

- Follow PEP8: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
- Use ``pycodestyle`` to automatically check for PEP8.


Type checking
-------------

- Consider using type hints: https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html
- Consider using http://mypy-lang.org.
- Consider verifying type annotations at runtime: https://github.com/RussBaz/enforce


Share your package
------------------

- Choose a license and add a LICENSE file.
- Share your package on PyPI. For this you can follow https://github.com/bast/pypi-howto.


Documentation
-------------

I used to recommend reStructuredText for READMEs in contrast to Markdown but
PyPI no longer requires reStructuredText. You can use Markdown as noted on
https://pypi.org/help/ under "How can I upload a project description in a
different format?".

Example shown here: https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#creating-setup-py
